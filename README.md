# IsoSolve notebook
IsoSolve is a computation framework to improve isotopic coverage and consolidate isotopic measurements by MS and/or NMR. IsoSolve is available from [this repository](https://github.com/MetaSys-LISBP/IsoSolve).

Here we provide an [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install.html) notebook with step-by-step examples on IsoSolve usage.
